# Shiny App for Viewing Labor Force Data

Currently set up to view data by one or more counties, specifically the counties in Eastern Iowa where I'm located. Code could be easily modified for different counties and their respective FIPS code. Althought right now you'll also need to swap out the county names in their respective location and the pre-selected counties.

Future plans
- add more functions/variables to clean up code and eliminate duplication
- make it possible to pass a dataframe of county FIPS codes and corresponding names to set the geos
